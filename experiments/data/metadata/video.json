        "description": "Welcome to my channel and today‚Äôs video is about modern bridge construction time lapse compilation.\nPeople have been carrying out bridge construction since humans first assembled into groups. The initial bridge design was basically felled trees that were utilized for moving over the ditches and rivers, and concrete bridges were rare. With the advance of civilization, new technologies and materials are helping engineers and construction professionals build bridges better and faster, while also improving maintenance for longer bridge life. \nThe technological aspects of construction influence the modern bridge industry from the very first steps of design. Entire families of bridges such as the launched bridges, the span by span bridges and the balanced cantilever bridges take the name itself from the construction method.\nNew generation bridge construction equipment is complex and delicate. It handles heavy loads on long spans under the same constraints that the obstruction to overpass exerts onto the bridge. Safety of operations and quality of the final product depend on complex interactions between human decisions, machine performance.\nIn spite of their complexity, these machines and modern construction technique are using to building new bridges without any errors year after year. Watching the bridge construction video is feeling like playing lego in real life. enjoy the video.\nüí¨ Let me know what you think about this video in the comment section below!\nIf you like the video, please SUBSCRIBE and don't forget to press the bell üîî, üëçlike, comment and share.
